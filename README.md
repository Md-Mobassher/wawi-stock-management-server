## Approach

This WaWi stock management server follows a **RESTful API architecture** with the following design principles:

- **Transaction-safe stock operations**: Prevents negative stock using transactions and locks
- **Idempotency**: Ensured with a unique `operationKey` for each stock operation
- **Immutable ledger**: Stock changes are always recorded in a ledger (never updated in place)
- **Summary view**: Provides stock totals per warehouse and overall
- **TypeScript + Prisma**: For strong typing and database abstraction
- **Zod validation**: Runtime validation for request/response data
- **Modular structure**: Clear separation of controllers, services, and routes
- **Error handling**: Centralized error responses with proper HTTP status codes
